<h1>A CLI BASED PATIENT RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h1>

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Many small medical clinics and centers especially in the upcountry region do not yet have a patient management system. 
This creates inefficiencies in terms of patient records management if they are only using paper records for example the records can get lost or misplaced or long queues when a patient comes for treatment as they await for their records to be retrieved.

PROBLEM SOLUTION

The solution to this problem is the creation of  an IT based patient records management system. 

The main advantage of this system is that it will be easy to use as it will serve as an introduction to the various IT patient management record systems to its users. Therefore the users will not feel as though they have a steep learning curve during the integration process.

This system will enable clinics and medical centers to manage the records of their various patients.

The user can:
Add a patient.
Delete a patient upon finalization of treatment from the particular medical center.
Update the records of a patient.
Retrieve the details of the users and patients upon request.


This system is targeted towards medical facilities that have not yet implemented an IT based system in their records management.
